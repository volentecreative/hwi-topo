 * drone-hero.js — the heavy-lift drone model drawn as line work, on a scroll-driven camera move onto one of its motors.
 *
 *   <section class="section_hero">                       <!-- ~200vh tall: the track -->
 *     <div class="hero_sticky">                          <!-- sticky, one viewport tall -->
 *       <div id="drone" style="position:absolute;inset:0"></div>
 *       …the copy…
 *     </div>

 *   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/volentecreative/hwi-topo@<commit>/drone-hero.js"></script>
 *   <script>DroneHero.mount('#drone', { focus: 'FR', track: 'closest:.section_hero' });</script>
 *
 * The model (heavy_lift_drone_model.glb, beside this script) is drawn as lines found on screen: a first pass writes
 * each pixel's normal, depth and part, a second draws a one-pixel line wherever those jump — silhouettes and creases
 * alike, the same weight everywhere, with nothing behind showing through. The landing-gear struts, which the model
 * stops short, are carried on down to the skids. The motors' casings (base, coil, cap, shaft) draw in the primary
 * colour, with vertical ribs; everything else in the secondary. The ribs and the floor grid are drawn as screen-space
 * quads with their own coverage, so they stay antialiased at any width. The model's
 * propellers are replaced with generated blades that turn as the page scrolls, neighbours counter-rotating. A floor
 * grid fades toward the frame's edges. With `track` set, the camera dollies along a path over that section's scroll
 * (and writes its progress to a CSS custom property, so the page's copy can move with it):
 * from the whole aircraft, head-on, round and down to beneath the focused motor, looking up at it with the rest of
 * the drone above and behind. Without a track it holds the end of the path. Colours come from CSS variables:
 *   --drone-primary    the motors             (falls back to --topo-label, then #f2f2f0)
 *   --drone-secondary  the rest of the drone  (falls back to --topo-label-secondary, then #9a9a96)
 *   --drone-grid       the floor grid         (falls back to --drone-secondary)
 *   --drone-face       the faces              (falls back to --topo-block, then #222322)
 *   --drone-bg         the canvas             (transparent by default)
